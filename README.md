# Kamiyapp – Skill Sharing Platform

Kamiyapp is a full-fledged web platform that connects skilled workers (like plumbers, electricians, mechanics) with users (requesters) who need on-demand services. The platform streamlines booking, inspection reporting, work tracking, feedback, and more — tailored to ensure a seamless workflow between service providers and clients.

- 🧑 Requester – books workers for specific skills and gives feedback after completion.
